      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p id="about-text">&emsp;Hello! I am currently a Computer Science student at Quincy University. Before school, I studied Python programming in my spare time. During my schooling, I built upon my previous knowledge by learning languages such as Java and C++. I then achieved an Associates in Computer Science at John Wood Community College. I pushed myself to leave my comfort zone by learning more about front end as well, such as the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My knowledge was expanded upon after transferring to a four year University where I dived deeper into the nuances of programming past the fundamentals. I am also pursuing a minor in Cyber Security. Currently, I strive to learn more about technology by developing personal projects. There is still so much I don't know, which is both overwhelming and exciting. </p>
