    "description": "This is a Pokemon Scarlet/Violet nuzlocke helper. Due to how the new games deal with random encounters, it is difficult to be able to have a random first encounter while allowing a player to be able to get all Pokemon in that area. This app fixes that by randomly selecting a Pokemon from the available pool for a certain area. I used React to make this project. It was my first time using React, so there was a bit of a learning curve for me. However, I was able to overcome those challenges and make something that I am proud of. ",
